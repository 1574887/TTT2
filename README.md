This is [TTT2] Trouble in Terrorist Town 2 (Advanced Update) - by Alf21 (open BETA)

THIS IS ONLY AN ADDON for TTT !

If you wanna have new features or bugfixes, report them here: https://github.com/Alf21/TTT2/issues/new

I created this addon to improve compatibility with other addons and erase those different "custom roles Addons" like "TTT Totem" or "TOT - Town of Terrorists" that doesn't work together.
To play in harmony, this addon is like a library for custom roles.

This addon is NOT COMPATIBLE with TTTTotem, Town of Terror or any other addon that overrides the original TTT files (like better equipment menues or smth like that). Thats not possible! But it's made to create a solution to get an option of making roles compatible and all the other things, if using this addon as a library ;)

It is necessary for every TTT2 custom role.
If you wanna try some of my roles, look at this collection: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1357745995

This addon is created out of files of the "TOT Addon" by KingNJenssons and files of the originally TTT gamemode (everything was extremely edited by me).

If you wanna add new items to the shop of a new role, you need to run „weaponshop“ in the developer console. Pick an equipment, choose the role and add it with clicking the button. There, you can connect shops with each other too.
